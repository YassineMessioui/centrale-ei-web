Using the interactive dashboard, several key indicators emerged as strong signals of potential fraudulent behavior across countries:

Phone Number Changes (last 6 months):
This feature was particularly significant in France and Germany. Fraudulent clients were twice as likely to have changed their phone number more than once compared to non-fraudulent clients.

Payment Method:
In Germany, payment method proved to be a highly discriminative factor: 77% of fraudsters used bank transfers, compared to just 6% of non-fraudsters. A similar, though less pronounced, trend was observed in France, with 16% of fraudsters using bank transfers versus 4% of non-fraudulent clients.

Company Age:
Across all countries, fraudulent companies tended to be younger. Most were less than 5 to 7 years old, while non-fraudulent companies showed a more even age distribution.

Client Activity:
Wholesale trade was the most common activity among fraudulent clients in all three countries. However, further insight is currently limited due to language barriers in column values, which require translation.

Material Leased:
Certain types of leased material also stood out as indicators. In France, for example, the use of multifunctional vehicles increased significantlyâ€”from 4% among non-fraudsters to 22% among fraudsters. Similar shifts in distribution were observed across other materials and countries.
